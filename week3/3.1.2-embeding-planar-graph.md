# Embeding Planar Graph

## Graph Embeding

### Tutte's Method

#### Adjacency Matrix Laplacian Form L

with 1/degree as elements

#### Calculate A= I - L

Zero out the nodes that have been placed on the planar graph

#### Solve A X = B for the coordinates

### Iteration: each node should the the average position of the neighboring nodes
